## 🕹️ Game Overview

**Sentient Pong** reimagines Pong with a twist:
- You control the **sentient ball** instead of a paddle.  
- No more left-vs-right paddles, just you versus the AI in a sudden-death arena.  
- The AI guards one side while you guard the other by controlling the ball’s path.
- First score **wins instantly** (sudden death).  

This keeps each round short, exciting, and competitive.
